    "sm_p1": "Anime and manga are more than entertainment — they are a reflection of the human experience. From the quiet melancholy of slice-of-life stories to the grand cosmic dramas of mecha epics, each title carries its own heart, philosophy, and rhythm. These works speak to the timeless emotions of growth, loss, hope, and identity, capturing them through the language of art and imagination. Every panel and every frame is a world built with care, connecting millions of people through shared emotion and wonder.",

    "sm_p2": "Behind every story stands a mangaka — an artist whose vision turns ink into universes. Figures like Osamu Tezuka, often called the 'God of Manga', paved the way for countless successors. Rumiko Takahashi brought warmth and humor to romantic chaos; Naoki Urasawa wove psychological thrillers that question morality and destiny; Eiichiro Oda built a world so vast and hopeful that readers grow up alongside his characters. Each creator is inspired by others — a living lineage of art where every generation passes on the spark of creativity.",

    "sm_p3": "Anime culture thrives on connection and diversity. It teaches that there is no single way to see the world: from the surreal symbolism of Satoshi Kon to the heartfelt simplicity of Kyoto Animation, each studio and artist offers a unique voice. Fans gather not just to consume, but to discuss, analyze, and create. Fan art, cosplay, AMVs, and fan fiction all grow from the same passion — the desire to belong to something beautiful and expressive. In this culture, participation is creation.",

    "sm_p4": "Supporting anime and manga culture means supporting empathy, artistry, and global storytelling. Every discussion thread, every convention meetup, and every local screening contributes to keeping these worlds alive. Through sharing, translating, and preserving, we ensure that voices from different eras and regions are not forgotten. The themes explored in anime — loneliness, courage, kindness, resilience — resonate across languages and generations. They remind us that vulnerability is strength and that hope can take any form, even in a hand-drawn line.",

    "sm_p5": "To love anime is to celebrate imagination itself. It is to see yourself in Shinji’s fear, in Chihiro’s growth, in Guts’s endurance, or in Lain’s isolation. It is to recognize that art can be both escapism and truth, that every frame might hold a mirror to our lives. The anime community is a mosaic of stories, perspectives, and dreams — proof that creativity knows no borders. When we watch, read, and share together, we carry forward not just fandom, but a living culture that keeps evolving with every heartbeat, every episode, every page.",
